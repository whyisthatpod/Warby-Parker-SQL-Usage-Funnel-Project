# Warby-Parker-SQL-Usage-Funnel-Project

In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that I was given:

Quiz Funnel:
-survey

Home Try-On Funnel:
-quiz
-home_try_on
-purchase

This project was a collaboration with Warby Parker’s Data Science team (thank you!) and uses fictional data.


My findings are presented in the Powerpoint file in this repository. It contains additional information about the project, a summary of my results and snippets of the code used to find the results. The data was located in SQL tables and all analyzation was completed using SQL.
